Description
-
A small project of mine aims to add more features to the default AddNPC. While Your good old AddNPC works as intended, I find it very limited. Therefore I present you this monstrosity.

* Ability to set output % damage increase/decrease:
>Damage resistance based on body parts.
* Ability to set random or specified body groups,
* Ability to set random or specified skins,
* Ability to set a custom material,
* Ability to override or edit sounds,
* Ability to edit model scale,
* Ability to edit bones, 
>Scale, position, angle or to enable jigglebones.
* Ability to add custom dispositions/relations, 
>Based on names, entity classes, NPC classes, VJ classes.
* Ability to increase/decrease the speed or even replace certain activities like reloading,
* Ability to set weapon proficiency and range,
* Full save and dupe support,
* Avaible custom functions to customise engine NPCs even further,
* Kill feed NPC' name support,
* Build in health renegeration mechanic,
* Support for inengine entities,
>Ever wanted a spawnable citadel super suit charger?
* Support for the Hammer Editor? 
>In theory you can change NPCs/Entity name to a certain ANP NPC/Entity and it will be appplied on the map load.
